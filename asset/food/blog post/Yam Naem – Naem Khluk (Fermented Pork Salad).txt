Arguably not as strange as the dishes preceding it on this list, Yam Naem is still one of several weird Thai food dishes that actually tastes great. What makes this ingredient weird to the Western palate is that it contains fermented uncooked pork.

Naem has a deliciously comforting flavor with a slight hint of sourness to it. Yam Naem, the salad, is one of the best things I’ve ever eaten. It’s filling, rich, and addictive. It’s also really hard to find someone who makes this dish well. But when you find that person, you’re in for a treat.

In Yam Naem, the chef combines the fermented pork with deep fried balls of rice, toasted peanuts, shallots, chili flakes, lime juice, and fish sauce. This dish hails from the Isaan region of Thailand, where arguably the country’s best food originates. 

I implore anyone visiting Thailand to seek out someone selling Yam Naem and try this dish. The warning I feel obliged to give you is that you’ll probably never want to go home after eating it.
