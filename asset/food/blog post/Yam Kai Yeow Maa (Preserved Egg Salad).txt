The Thais prepare this funky salad using century eggs, which are blackened eggs that are preserved for months at a time. Over the course of the preservation process, the eggs darken, with the yolk taking on a creamy consistency and the whites becoming translucent brown.

The eggs also take on a rather odd aroma, which influences the name that Thais use for such eggs, Yeow Maa meaning horse pee. 

Now, you might wonder why the heck you’d ever want something that smells like horse pee, but hear me out. The smell isn’t actually that strong, and it becomes completely non-apparent when paired with a salad including lots of coriander, lime juice, and fish sauce.

The creaminess of the century eggs in Yam Kai Yeow Maa constrasts exquisitely with the zesty dressing, heat from freshly chopped Thai chilis, and chunks of shallot.
