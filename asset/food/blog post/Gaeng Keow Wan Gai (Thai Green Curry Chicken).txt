Savory authentic Thai Green Curry Chicken (gaeng keow wan gai) featuring chunks of tender chicken with eggplant, zucchini and herbs.

Curry is a staple dish of Thailand introduced by Indian immigrants over the past several hundred years. It is affordable and considered a healthy part of the Thai diet. High in vitamins and rich in protein, it is easily digested when eaten spooned over steamed jasmine rice or kanom jeen (round rice noodles).

An interesting tidbit is that green curry is the only type of Thai curry paste made with fresh Thai chilies. All other types of curry paste are made up of dried Thai chilies. The addition of coconut milk gently mellows the heat of the fresh Thai chilies without compromising their flavorful contribution to the dish.

This classic Thai dish shot to the top of list of potential candidates to pair with our wine of the month pick as part of our monthly wine pairing challenge.  The 2013 French Viognier, produced out of the Costières de Nîmes in the Rhone Valley’s most southern vineyard by Michel Gassier, paired amazingly well.

Prior to cooking, soften the diced eggplant by gently tossing with sea salt in a colander, leave for 10 minutes, then rinse off. This will result in a delicately textured eggplant that melts in your mouth.
