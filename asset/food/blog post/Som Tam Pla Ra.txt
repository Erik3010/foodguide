Som tam, or papaya salad, is regarded as one of the world’s great dishes. In fact, it made it onto the most recent CNN list of “50 best dishes in the world.”

When many people come to Thailand and eat som tam, they are actually eating a particular version of som tam, known as som tam Thai. I like som tam Thai, but it’s a bit too sweet for me. 

By far a more strange, yet delicious version of som tam is the version eaten throughout Isaan, and northern Thailand, known as som tam pla ra. What makes this dish count as one of the weird Thai food dishes is the inclusion of pla ra, which is essentially rotten fish sludge. There is no sexier way of describing it. 

Pla ra is fish that has fermented for six months with salt and toasted rice, which gives it an incredibly strong and sometimes unpleasant smell. It’s the type of smell that would make you wonder, “who the heck actually allows this stuff to enter their body?”

But as the genius cooks of Thailand figured out, something magical happens when you add pla ra to the traditional som tam recipe. You get an added element of saltiness and extreme sourness that tastes absolutely astonishing. You lose that sickly sweetness that a som tam Thai often tastes of. The intense sourness comes from the lactic acid that builds up when you ferment fish for a long time. 

To me, som tam pla ra is like a drug: I just cannot get enough of it. My stomach often hates me for going overboard with it, but this salad is one of the tastiest I’ve ever eaten. 

If a Thai person spots you eating Tam Pla Ra, you’ll know about it from the surprise on their face and in their voice, even though you might not quite understand what they’re saying. 

Try to get over the odd smell and I promise you that you will order this dish again and again. It’s that good.
