Laab Mote Daeng is one of those weird Thai food dishes that makes people cringe when they hear what goes into making it. Essentially, Laab Mote Daeng gets its name from the fact that eggs from red ants are used to prepare the dish.

Laab is a famous Lao/Thai salad that should be sour, spicy,  and refreshing from mint, with the texture of khao khua, toasted rice powder, adding bite to it. 

Traditionally, laab gets its sour taste from generous dashings of lime juice. In laab mote daeng, red ants and their eggs replace the minced meat typically served with laab. This exotic delicacy honestly should be tried by everyone at least once because it tastes so unexpectedly great.

The ants and their eggs taste exactly like lime juice, and they burst with this sour flavor with each mouthful. It you can put behind your preconceptions about the prospect of eating ant eggs, I promise you this dish is rewarding. 

To me, Laab Mote Daeng is the perfect showcase of the innovative genius of Thai cooks. I mean, I’d love to know who sat down one day and went, “You know what, I bet these ant eggs taste good.”, thereafter proceeding to base an entire salad out of such a strange exotic ingredient.
