The idea of raw prawns is, well, an odd one to say the least. I’ve eaten sushi at many Japanese restaurants and never have I once encountered a raw prawn, although I’m sure they are available. Yet the Thais eat them in this dish like it’s the most natural thing in the world. 

Goong Chae Nam Pla is a dish of extremely fresh uncooked prawns bathed in a spicy, sour, and salty sauce with just a hint of sweetness from palm sugar. The prawns are typically arranged beautifully on a bed of sliced cabbage and cucumbers.

The Thais often wash their marinated raw prawns down with some cold beers, such as Leo or Chang.  The Nam Pla in the title refers to the dish’s generous use of fish sauce. 

Goong Chae Nam Pla is typically chilled for about 15 minutes prior to serving, which preserves the freshness and gives the shrimp more flavor. The best way I can describe the taste of soft raw shrimp is buttery and slightly sweet; it genuinely tastes surprisingly good.

The addition of copious amounts of garlic, chili, lime juice, and fish sauce ensures a zingy fresh flavor that complements the soft buttery shrimp perfectly. Crunchy vegetables add texture and bite to the dish. 

Goong Chae Nam Pla definitely falls under the category of weird Thai food dishes that taste great. But only order it if you can become comfortable with the notion of raw prawns.
