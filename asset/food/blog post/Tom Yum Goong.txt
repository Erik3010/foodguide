Tom Yum is one of the most famous dishes in Thailand.

In Thai language, “Tom” means the process of boiling, and “Yum” refers to a sour and spicy Thai salad.

Tom Yum is a sour and spicy soup typically made with lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves, chilis, garlic, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, fish sauce and a lot of lime juice.

Tom Yum is usually served in a large bowl or in an aluminum hot pot that has a charcoal burner.

The soup usually features a meat such as beef, chicken or pork, but the most popular additive is shrimp (Goong in Thai).
