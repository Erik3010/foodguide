Kale bears semblance to "kail", a variant of "cawul" (from Scotland and northern England) for various cabbages.

Until the end of the Middle Ages, kale was one of the most common green vegetables in Europe. Curly-leaved varieties of cabbage already existed along with flat-leaved varieties in Greece in the fourth century BC. It was also used as medicinal food source. Disocorides wrote that it could be used to treat bowel ailments. These forms, which were referred to by the Romans as Sabellian kale, are considered to be the ancestors of modern kales.

Kale was brought to North America by the colonists in the 16th century. Later, Russian kale was introduced into Canada, and then into the United States, by Russian traders in the 19th century.

During World War II, the cultivation of kale (and other vegetables) in the U.K. was encouraged by the Dig for Victory campaign. The vegetable was easy to grow and provided important nutrients missing from a diet because of rationing.
